Codecademy Ready Course Project
Focus on: Responsive Design for Tablets and Phones

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Improvements to come:

- Product images need to be centered in .product-image [DONE]
  PATH: .product-image < .product < .product-grid < .container < body
  
- Product containers & Location/Hours need to "flex" in mobile screen sizes
  Currently works for desktop, but stops flexing at tablet size
